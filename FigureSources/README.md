Pipeline for the creation of each of the figures.

There is a .graffle file for each figure, which is the main method of compiling sub-components of the figure and making aesthetic changes.

Figure 1: everything required for this figure is in the graffle and associated Mathematica notebook of the same name.

Figure 2: for part (a), see the associated Mathematica notebook. For part (b), the plots are `1PSD_..` and `2PSD_..` which can be made using the script specific_communities.m which can also be found in this directory. 

Figure 3: everything required for this figure is in the graffle and associated Mathematica notebook of the same name.

Figure 4: the plots are made using the script analyse_spatial_model.py in this directory, for which the data can be found in ./../SimulationCode/results/simulation_statistics/PSD-1-antibiotic/stats/.  

Figure 5: the heatmap on the left is again made using ./analyse_spatial_model.py,and the simplex on the right is colour_simplex.py which is made using the script colour_simplex.py

All supplementary figures are standalone and do not make use of any data.
